# tamil-unicode-reverser
This script is a Python program that converts between Tamil Unicode and English transliteration. It reads a mapping file containing character mappings between Tamil and English characters and provides two functionalities:

It can convert Tamil Unicode strings to their corresponding English transliteration based on the provided mapping.
It can also reverse the operation, converting English transliteration back to Tamil Unicode using the reversed mapping.
The program takes user input for the desired operation and provides the converted output. The accuracy and quality of the conversion depend on the completeness and correctness of the character mappings provided in the mapping file.
